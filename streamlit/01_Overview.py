I suspect it's not a function of focus so much as a function of time-on-road - every trip cuts in half for everyone and suddenly everyone has half as much time around each other on the road to collide - which is actually less than half because probabilistically they'll share significantly less road time overlapping so it won't be another car on the road with you for 3 minutes instead of 6 - you'll just not be on the road together at all because one of you is at home.
